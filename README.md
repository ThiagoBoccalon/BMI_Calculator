# BMI_Calculator
This project will be able to help you to calculate your body mass index (BMI) for adults.
To use the calculator, you will need to know your height and weight.

BMI is calculated in two steps.
1. Squaring your height in metres: 1.73 x 1.73 = 2.99
2. Dividing your weight in kilograms: 70 / 2.99 = 23.41

And then, your result will be able to show as underweight, normal, overweight or obese.


To build this app I used [.NET MAUI Radial Gauge Control](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/radial-gauge/getting-started).
